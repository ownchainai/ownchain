> Creation is Asset, Social is Ownable

OwnChain is a revolutionary social media token layer protocol designed to add ownership, value capture, and cross-platform interoperability layers to existing social media platforms through blockchain technology. We are not creating another social media platform, but building the underlying value infrastructure for all existing and future social media.

## Project Vision and Mission

**Vision**: Redefine the economic model of social media, allowing creators and users to truly own and benefit from their content and data.

**Mission**:
- Provide a unified tokenization layer for social media platforms
- Enable cross-platform content value capture for creators
- Empower users with ownership and control over their personal data
- Create a more fair and transparent social media economic system
